                <p>Javascript is a flexible multi-paradigm programming language largely used in the web-development space for both front-end and back-end applications. Whereas HTML and CSS describe the elements on a webpage, code written in JavaScript makes them interactive. A framework such as NodeJS allows back-end code to be written in JavaScript. The tutorials below provide tips and tricks on how to get started with Javascript.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side Javascriprt extends the core language by supply object to control a brower and its Document Object Mode. For example, Client-side extension allows an applicationselements on an HTML form and responds to user events such clicks, from inpput, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side Javascriprt extends the core language by supplying object to running Javascriprt on a server. For example, Server-side extension allow an applicationsto communicate with a database, provide continuty of information feom one invocation to another of the applications,or perfoem file manipulation on a server.</li>

                <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
                    <li>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</li>
                    <li>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.</li>

                <p> It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.

                    The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</p>

                To get startedwith writting Javascriprt, open the Scratchpad a your first "Hello World" Javascriprt code:
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName)  {alert("Hello" + yourName); }
                </code>
                Select the code in the pad and hit ctrl+R to watch it unfold brower!

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
            <p>A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static. There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.</p>
            <br>
